<h3>Project Banana</h3>
<p>The project 'baNaNa' is a self-organised seminar from the PhD
students of the numerical analysis department at TU Delft. Our aim is to present
practical tools and applications from the every-day use of a mathematician
to each other. The seminar will be held on a bi-weekly basis and in an
informal manner. Everyone is welcome to join our talks and contribute
from time to time...</p>
