The first lecture will be about how to use Git and [Github]. This is a powerfull, open source tool that is already installed on our work place computers and it can be used quite easily for version control of a (larger) software project. We will show some of the basic commands and demonstrate how to use it for a new project. FYI: This homepage has also been built by [Joost], [Guido] and [Manuel] using github.
