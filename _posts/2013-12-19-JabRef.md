I am using [JabRef] for the organization of my references in LaTeX. It is a smart little tool that is open source and available for all operating systems I can think of. In a short session, I will explain how JabRef is used in compination with LaTeX. I will also give some examples of my bib-files and present useful tricks that make working with JabRef very convenient.
